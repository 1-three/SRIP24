4. The complaint on file No. 28/2023 was submitted on 05.12.2023 accompanied with an application on file No. 297/2023 submitted by Directorate of Enforcement (ED) for considering the date of institution of the said complaint to be the date on which the complaint was first instituted by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) before the Principal Sessions Judge, Jammu (also a designated PMLA Court under the Act of 2002) i.e., 06.09.2023 which was declined from being entertained by the Principal Sessions Judge, Jammu by virtue of an order dated 20.10.2023 requiring the presentation of the said complaint before the competent court in accordance with law thereby returning the complaint to the Special Public Prosecutor of the Directorate of Enforcement (ED).

5. The court of Special Judge Anti-Corruption (CBI cases) Jammu though actually came to be presented with the complaint on 04.11.2023 accompanied with an application on file No. 297/2023 but its actual entertainment came to take place on 05.12.2023 relating the institution of the complaint ante-dated to be 06.09.2023 when it was first presented to the court of Principal Sessions Judge, Jammu but not to the Special Judge Anti-Corruption (CBI Cases), Jammu.

11. Following the heels of the said development in the State of Rajasthan, a report No. Home/AR/151/2017 dated 11.05.2018 from the Home Department, Govt. of the then State of Jammu and Kashmir purportedly pertaining with the cases of fraudulent and illegally issued gun licences in the course of period from 2012-2016, came into being which resulted in registration of two FIRs, namely, an FIR No. 11 of 2018 dated 17.05.2018 registered by the Vigilance Organization Jammu (VOJ) and an FIR No. 18/2018 dated 18.05.2018 registered by the Vigilance Organization Kashmir (VOK).

16. With respect to FIR No. 18 of 2018 of Vigilance Organization Kashmir (VOK), the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Chandigarh came to re-number the said FIR as FIR No. RCCHG0512018S007 dated 17.10.2018 against the Deputy Commissioner, Kupwara and others.

17. It is after a period of one and half year of registration of the aforesaid two FIRs by the CBI, Chandigarh that the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) emerged on the scene by registering an enquiry on file No. ECIR/JMSZO/04/2020 dated 13.03.2020 relating the same to the aforesaid two FIRs i.e. FIR No. 11 of 2018 and 18 of 2018 of Vigilance Organization, Jammu (VOJ) and Vigilance Organization, Kashmir (VOK) respectively.

The said two chargesheets do not name the petitioners in any manner and in any capacity whatsoever.

20. Similarly, with respect to its FIR No. RCCHG0512018S006 dated 16.10.2018, the CBI, Chandigarh came forward with presentation of five Final Police Reports/Chargesheets before the Special Judge, Anti Corruption (CBI Cases), Jammu. The said chargesheets are:

            (i)     31 of 2022 dated 30.11.2022

            (v)     35 of 2022 dated 14.12.2022


23. With respect to the two final police reports/chargesheets presented before the Special Judge Anti-Corruption (CBI Cases), Srinagar, the accused came to be so named in the said two chargesheets are as under:

       S. No.   Name of the Accused                                            With effect from

9. Modh. Imran Lohri, Arms and Ammunition Dealer and owner of M/s Imran Gun House, Anantnag.

10. Mohd. Shafiq Arms and Ammunition Dealer and owner of M/s Kotwal Gun House.

24. Thus, in none of the afore-listed chargesheets, the petitioners figure in any manner by any reference much less as accused therein and as such are to be said in the eyes of law unrelated with the aforementioned criminal cases so generated out of two original FIRs i.e., 11 of 2018 and 18 of 2018 later re-numbered by the CBI, Chandigarh and resulting in presentation of final police reports/chargesheets.
