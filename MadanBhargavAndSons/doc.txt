     requiring the presentation of the said complaint before the competent court

     in accordance with law thereby returning the complaint to the Special

     Public Prosecutor of the Directorate of Enforcement (ED).

     actually came to be presented with the complaint on 04.11.2023

     accompanied with an application on file No. 297/2023 but its actual

     backdrop of which the complainant-Directorate of Enforcement (ED)

     came forward with the institution of the complaint naming the petitioners

     as accused persons/concerns in the list of twenty one (21) accused

     persons/concerns.

      the petitioners came forward complaining that when in none of the

      aforesaid FIRs and the chargesheets borne out of them they were and/or

      are related with alleged commission of any alleged offences to figure as

      accused persons investigated and chargesheeted by the CBI, Chandigarh,

      then the jurisdiction exercised by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) to

      implicate the petitioners in the case is nothing but usurpation of the

      jurisdiction of booking the petitioners without any statutory basis leaving

      the petitioners clueless as to by reference to which culpable statement of

      facts they have been booked in the company of nineteen (19) other

      accused persons with whom they have no privity of transaction.

29.   The complaint, in the context of the petitioners, proceeds with its first

      firms were seized and list of documents which comprised of sixteen (16)

      loose sheets and seven (7) original arms licences were also seized.

      summons and persons examined under Section 50(2) and (3) of

      PMLA along with opportunities allowed to accused/co-accused to

      discharge burden of proof as stipulated under Section 24 of PMLA."

32.   Under paragraph 8 "Brief summary of result of investigation under

36.   With reference to recovery of movable properties during search and

      seizure conducted under Section 17 of the Act of 2002, the reference with

      respect to the petitioner No. 2 is in para 9.2 wherein gold jewellery

      weighing 1765 gms is said to be recovered from the residential house of

      the petitioner No. 2 and seven (07) arms licences in original were found

      and seized during search thereby relating it to the petitioner No. 2.

37.   Under paragraph 11 "Specific role of the accused/co-accused/persons

      abetting the commission of offence of money laundering by

      directly/indirectly attempting to indulge or knowingly assisting or

      knowingly       being     a        party   or     being      involved      in

      concealment/possession/acquisition or use in projecting or claiming

      Proceeds of Crime as untainted property in terms of Section 3 of

      PMLA", the reference to petitioner No. 2 is under para 11.10 whereby

      the petitioner No. 2 is alleged to have, in the guise of his various firms

      authorized to keep/sale/purchase of arms and ammunition, illegally and

      fraudulently indulged in issuance of arms licences for army personnel in

      lieu of monetary benefits to the petitioner No. 2 and his family members

      and also used various bank accounts of firms related to him and his

      family members to receive illegal funds/commissions generated out of

      criminal activities related to illegal issuance/renewal of arms licence by

      flouting the norms, procedures and rules governing the Arms Act, 1959

      and that illegal funds so received from army personnel who had applied

      and sought renewal of their arm licences through petitioner No. 2 and his

      firm are said to have integrated into the movable and immovable

      properties held by petitioner No. 2 in his name and name of his families.
                                    14                        CRM(M) No. 194/2024
38.   The petitioner No. 2 is thus alleged to have directly indulged in criminal

      activities related to scheduled offences under Section 2(1) (x) & 2(1) (y)

      of the Act of 2002 and committed the offence of money laundering under

      Section 3 of the Act of 2002 punishable under Section 4 of the Act of

      2002.

39.   With reference to petitioner No. 1 it is by reference to the same set of

      averments related to petitioner No. 2 that the implication of petitioner

      No. 1 is referred under section 11.20 at page 269 of the complaint.

40.   By drawing heavy reference and reliance from the judgment of the

      Supreme Court of India in the case of "Vijay Madanlal Choudhary and

      Ors Vs. Union of India and ors" reported in 2022 (10) Scale 577 and of

      Delhi High Court in case of "Prakash Industries Ltd Vs. Union of

      India and ors and Prakash Thermal Power Ltd vs. Union of India"
      reported in 2023 DHC 481, the learned counsel for the petitioners assail

      their very naming as accused persons in the complaint when the

      petitioners do not figure, by any stretch of reference, in commission of

      any scheduled offence in terms of Section 3 read with section 2(1) (y) of

      the PMLA, 2002.

41.   The learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently submits that the court

      below has not at all exercised any application of mind to the facts and

      circumstances of the case in the context of the petitioners.

      The petitioners also assail the institution of the complaint given a

      retrospect date by the court below to the serious prejudice of the

      petitioners' entitlement with respect to legal status of the seizure of the

      petitioner No. 2's assets/movable properties.
                                                    15                        CRM(M) No. 194/2024
           42. Prima facie case made out particularly in the manner the court of Special

                     Judge Anti-Corruption (CBI Cases) Jammu has, in a very cryptic order of

                     one and half page, has come to take cognizance of the complaint against

                     the petitioners figuring in the array of twenty one (21) accused

                     persons/concerns without undertaking any examination of the complaint as

                     to in which manner and on what basis the petitioners are being subjected

                     to prosecution at the instance of the complaint-Enforcement Directorate

                     (ED).

           43. Issue notice to the respondent.

           44. Petitioners to furnish registered postal cover for service of the respondent

                     within ten (10) days whereupon Registrar Judicial, Jammu to issue notice.

           45. List again on 07.06.2024.

           46. In the meantime, proceedings in the complaint against the petitioners shall

                     remain stayed till next date of hearing. This direction is, however, subject

                     to objections of the respondent and consideration thereof.


                                                                     (RAHUL BHARTI)
                                                                         JUDGE
